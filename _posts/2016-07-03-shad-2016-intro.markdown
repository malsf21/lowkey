For the next month or so, I'm going to spend my time at McMaster University completing the SHAD program, which in short is a sciences and "life" camp where candidates stay at Canadian universities for a month. While I'm there, I'll update you guys (or the one person who actually does read my blog) on what's going on, including projects that I work on, and people that I meet. Hopefully, it'll be an awesome time!

While I'm there, I'm still going to work on my projects (namely OMUN.ca/app, WAC, status, and maybe a convergence website), but I'm also going to be doing cool stuff with the cool people at SHAD. Maybe I'll be able to preview a few projects, who knows? I'm also going to be doing a SHADspeak, which is kinda like a TED talk but to the SHAD members: I'll link it here when I'm finished.

SHAD runs from July 3rd to July 29th. You can find their website [here](http://shad.ca).

Thanks for reading, and I'll see you guys soon!
