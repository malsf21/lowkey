**Just to be very clear,** this list isn't about the *best* albums critically, but rather how they've changed me as a music listener, and a person. This next album is exactly that: while it's not an amazing album musically, it was my first rap album, and damn, that stuff was catchy. I'm excited to present to you...

## Album #14: B.o.B Presents: The Adventures of Bobby Ray

On May 16, 2000, Eminem released *The Real Slim Shady*: one of the most iconic songs of the decade. He playfully disses and insults celebrities and gives braggadocios lyrics, making it a radio hit: #1 in the UK, and #4 on the Billboard Top 100. Along with the Marshall Mathers LP, the song received critical success and won a Grammy for best Rap Performance.

Why am I telling you about an Eminem song in the year 2000? What does it have to with B.o.B's *The Adventures of Bobby Ray*? Well, after Eminem gained so much mainstream attention, other people tried doing the same thing. Eminem, in a way, was the birth of "pop rap": hip-hop that was radio catchy, and appealed to the masses (though this wasn't its intention). Before Eminem, big rappers like Jay-Z and Biggie weren't necessarily radio famous: their songs catered to a specific subgenre of rap listeners. With Eminem's broader appeal (and also that he was white, but that's another story to tell), hip-hop became a much broader music market. One of those rappers to aim for this trend was B.o.B.

*The Adventures of Bobby Ray* is the first studio album by Georgia rapper B.o.B. Coming out of a few mixtapes and singles, as well as XXL's Class of 2009 (a pretty big statement), he released *Adventures*. But the album wasn't a bunch of bangers: staying in style with pop rap, the song was filled with radio hits, catchy and simple raps, and a very watered down version of what most hardcore rappers would call rap. While it received international acclaim, with hit singles like *Airplanes*, *Magic*, and *Nothin' On You*, it was largely regarded as a bad album by the rap community. And I don't disagree: his raps don't have that much depth or level, and if you wanted to listen to a pop rapper why wouldn't you listen to *Drake* or *Kanye*?

Well, little Grade 4 me didn't really know about *Kanye* since his songs were rarely on the radio, and Drake songs were way too complicated for a kid who doesn't speak English as his first language. On the other hand, B.o.B made a bunch of radio-friendly singles that were simple to hum along to; let's take a look at *Magic*, by B.o.B featuring Rivers Cuomo (Weezer's lead singer):

> I got the magic in me

> Every time I touch that track it turns into gold

> Everybody knows I got the magic in me

> When I hit the floor, the girls come snappin at me

> Now everybody wants some presto magic, magic, magic

They're not complicated, they're pretty fun, and most importantly for me, pretty easy to sing along to. Plus, I wanted magic; I wanted the Midas touch, and I definitely wanted girls snapping at me. It was the simplicity and catchiness that got to me.

Now I wasn't the only person that thought so: a lot of my friends at the time also liked songs like *Airplanes*. So we sang along to them; rapped along to them; and enjoyed ourselves with them. It helped that songs like *Don't Let Me Fall*, *Nothin' On You*, or *Magic* weren't explicit, so our parents were mostly fine with us talking about our presto magic.

I was excited to learn more about this awesome, super cool guy, so I went to the library and picked up a CD (I'll take *sentences that nobody would say in 2016 for 300*). I played it on my black MP3 player and jammed out to every single song on the album: *Nothin' On You* was very sweet and lovely, and *Bet I* made my feel like a cool thug and gangster (though, I was far from that).

Looking back on it, B.o.B is not one of my favourite artists. Revisiting his other albums, like *Strange Clouds*, *Underground Luxury*, or *Psycadelik Thoughtz*, didn't give me any satisfaction: just like *Adventures*, they are poor albums. Combined with the fact that B.o.B believes that the earth is flat and [tried to diss Neil DeGrasse Tyson](https://soundcloud.com/bobatl/bob-flatline-feat-neil-tyson) makes me kinda weirded out that I used to like this guy.

**But, the sentimental value isn't lost.** This album was a lot of my Grade 4/5/6, which at the time, was 1/3rd of my life. A lot of my grade school friends still remember fondly songs like *Airplanes* or *Nothin' On You*, and it brings back some rose-coloured memories. This album wasn't only that though: it drove me to explore other areas of Rap, and Pop: I never would've learned about Bruno Mars if it wasn't for *Nothin' On You*, or Paramore if it wasn't for *Airplanes*, or Eminem if it wasn't for *Airplanes, Part II*. It kickstarted me **actually caring about music, instead of just listening to random radio songs on the way to school.** And it's for that introduction to music that I place *B.o.B Presents: The Adventures of Bobby Ray* as Album #14. And hey, maybe *I could use a dream or a genie or a wish, to go back to a place much simpler than this.*

**Favourite Songs**: *Don't Let Me Fall, Nothin' On You, Airplanes, Bet I, The Kids, Magic, Fame*

Thanks for reading! Next time, we'll talk about an exceptional band, that's also an exception!
