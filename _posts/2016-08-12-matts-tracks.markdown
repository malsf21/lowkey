**As you probably don't know**, one of my personal projects (stuff that I work on when I don't have to work on FoodSpan or school stuff) is [Status](https://github.com/malsf21/status), a set of tools that tells you things about me. It's buggy as hell, and terribly coded, but it's alright: I still like it.

One of the newer features I've added is a "look back" to my music listening habits, called [Matt's Tracks](http://matthewwang.me/status/matts-tracks.html). Using Spotify's Web API, it looks into my Top 50 tracks for the month, every month. While it has very limited functionality, but it's been pretty nice to see some trends that I am able to explain.

For example, it's super easy to figure out my favourite artists. Logic dominates the July/August period (his new mixtape dropped, which explains why so much of *Bobby Tarantino* fills the Top 50), and has some recurring features when you compare across periods: other recurring artists include Kanye, Chance the Rapper, and Drake. In addition, it's interesting to note that rap tops the list (pretty obvious, it's my favourite genre), and of those subcategories it's mostly bangers and Logic. Lots and lots of workout music, party music, gaming music. In addition, the non-hip-hop songs, while few and far apart, also represent some of my favourites. The Mowgli's, Flume, and Down With Webster are some of those examples.

It's a small project for now, and means very little (only two months of data), but as time goes on maybe it'll prove more useful.

Until next time!

*P.S. Expect a more in-depth analysis of music soon!*
