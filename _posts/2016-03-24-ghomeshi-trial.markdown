Today, [Jian Ghomeshi was acquitted of all charges](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/horkins-decision-ghomeshi-1.3505808). While my major complaint is that [SHAD](http://www.thespec.com/news-story/5566639-rapper-shad-takes-over-from-ghomeshi-on-cbc/) might not host the Q anymore, there's [a lot of uproar concerning the decision](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/03/24/ghomeshi-decision_n_9541386.html): namely, that "This was an insult to women". I don't think that's what this trial is about though: what it does do is demonstrate to us how public opinion is shaped by testimony, whether or not there is evidence to back it up, and how ultimately society often sides with the victim, regardless of proof.

I could try to give you a summary of the case, but [The Globe and Mail has a pretty good summary themselves](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/jian-ghomeshi-watch-what-you-missed-in-the-case/article28476713/). What's pretty important to note is the lack of consistent testimony: [in Justice Horkin's decision](http://www.cbc.ca/news/jian-ghomeshi-sexual-assault-trial-ruling-1.3505446), he tells us:

> the volume of serious deficiencies in the evidence leaves the court with a reasonable doubt

The strength of this statement goes beyond just lack of evidence: "beyond reasonable doubt" is a cornerstone of both the [Canadian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt#Canada), and most [Western Liberal Democracy-based justice systems](http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/beyond+a+reasonable+doubt). It hinges on the burden of proof being on *the prosecution*, and *reliable evidence* as the form of proof required. In the Ghomeshi trial, we received neither.

The first witness, who's name is under publication ban, straight up said she had no contact with Ghomeshi after the alleged incident, but then later admitted that she had emailed him a year later, with some suggestive photos. The second witness, Lucy DeCoutere, had stated that she had no romantic interest for Ghomeshi, but then later in court several emails were brought up with her specifying her romantic interest for Ghomeshi. The third witness had similar consistency issues, failing to disclose a consensual sexual act between her and Ghomeshi.

Normally, a prosecution with such weak evidence would be destroyed by the public eye; but this case is a little different. Normally in cases of sexual assault, the victim is believed until proved otherwise: directly contradicting the judicial principle of [innocent until proven guilty](http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Innocent+until+proven+guilty). It's interesting to note that in the beginning of the trials and accusations, [many editorials were against Ghomeshi](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/11/03/ed-sock-jian-ghomeshi-facebook_n_6096092.html), and even led to him [being fired](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2014/10/26/cbc_fires_jian_ghomeshi_over_sex_allegations.html). That's a case that had no evidence, and no legal ruling: just the accusation practically ruined Ghomeshi's career. Not a great precedent that we want to set in our legal system, is it? We shouldn't give so much power to the accuser, without them providing reliable evidence on why those claims are true. If we do, it makes it easier to ruin people's lives with just a few words.

Obviously, there's more than just witness testimony. People will often see an accusation, and automatically associate it with a possibility of truth: that's what got [Ghomeshi fired](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2014/10/26/cbc_fires_jian_ghomeshi_over_sex_allegations.html). Though, as the public, we should probably try our best to take accusations with a grain of salt, until we get more of an explanation as to why and how anything happened.

I'm not saying that Ghomeshi is a saint, or that he 100% didn't do anything that was accused of him. But, until we can prove what happend *beyond a reasonable doubt*, I'm going to maintain faith in Horkin's verdict.

To end off this article, here's a very good quote floating around the internet about the trial:

>It's entirely possible to believe the victims, hate the verdict and still agree the acquittal was correct.
