I just turned 17, and it's been an interesting year - I've talked about that before and I'll talk about it again. More unremarkably, it also marks 1 year since I came up with my [15at15]({{site.baseurl}}/specials/15at15/) list, where I went over my Top 15 Albums at 15. Even though very few people read this blog at all, I've already received some hate on this list. I can empathize - I don't agree with these rankings (mostly) anymore either. I'm going to quickly go through what I'd change in this list now that I'm 1 (or 2, depending on how you view it) years older.

## The List

Firstly, here's a summarised version of the list (I apologize for the weird formatting):

* #15 Sound & Color
* #14 B.o.B Presents: The Adventures of Bobby Ray
* #13 Paramore
* #12 Coloring Book
* #11 Death Of A Bachelor
* #10 Recovery
* #9 1989
* #8 Acid Rap
* #7 Oracular Spectacular
* #6 Doo-Wops and Hooligans
* #5 The Black Parade
* #4 Graduation
* #3 To Pimp A Butterfly
* #2: Too Weird To Live, To Rare To Die
* #1: Under Pressure

If you'd like, you can find my initial thoughts on those albums [here]({{site.baseurl}}/specials/15at15/).

To be quite honest, I'd actually keep most of the list the same. The largest changes would be from 11-15, as I've listened to new music and there are some albums I definitely like more, but other than that most of the core stays the same. I'll briefly give you my new and improved 11-15, and then talk about 3 big changes I'd make in the top 10 (which I'll include in a follow-up post).

## The New 11-15

Surprise surprise, but only one album out of the 4 remains on the new 15at17 list, and it's *Paramore*.

![Paramore Album Cover]({{site.baseurl}}/img/albums/paramore.jpg)

Paramore's self-titled still sticks with me - there's a kind of emotion and passion that you get out of Hayley Williams' voice that you don't get out of most artists, period. In addition to what I said earlier, I also like how I can distinctly tell they're a band - you couldn't replace the rest of Paramore with just some filler guitarists.

Something I do want to note is that I also really liked Paramore's new album, *After Laughter*, even if it does depart from the style that I liked in their eponymous album. I actually really, really like *After Laughter* - if it wasn't for the backstory in *Paramore* (which I explain [here](http://127.0.0.1:4000/15at15/2016/08/19/top-15-at-15-part-three.html)), *After Laughter* might be on my top 15 list, but I weighed that heavily when I made this list, and I'll weigh it the same.

As for *Coloring Book*, and *Sound & Color*, I still like both of these albums. But, their personal touch isn't as large as, let's say, *Under Pressure*, and I've found other albums that I'd put on this list instead because I both like them and they have a larger personal aspect to me.

The first would be BROCKHAMPTON's *SATURATION* (1). BROCKHAMPTON is a new "boy band"/rap group that has taken the indie rap community by storm - they feature a diverse set of singers, rappers, producers, and styles. I was a big fan of SATURATION, but I also bonded with other friends over this love - and I plan to go to my first touring artist concert EVER at BROCKHAMPTON's Love Your Parents Tour.

![Pure Heroine Album Cover]({{site.baseurl}}/img/albums/pure-heroine.png)

The second would be Lorde's *Pure Heroine*. After giving it a listen late last year, I fell in love with this album and Lorde's voice - similar to *Sound & Color*, I think there's something special and unique about Lorde as a vocalist that conveys an emotion same to no other. Relistening to songs like Royals and Team was a wave of nostalgia, but I found new favourites in The Love Club, Glory and Gore, and Million Dollar Bills. After listening to *Pure Heroine*, I became addicted to Lorde's voice (just like heroin) and I also loved *Melodrama* - I'm super happy about the Oscar nom!

*Death of a Bachelor* and *B.o.B Presents: The Adventures of Bobby Ray* are interesting choices on the list. Now, I'm not a huge fan of either of the albums: I spoke of how dated The Adventures of Bobby Ray already is, and Death of a Bachelor hasn't aged well in my opinion. Still, they're deeply personal for me, but I think that songs on this list (at least moving forward) need to be personally impactful AND good albums, and unfortunately neither of these albums hold up.

![Future Friends Album Cover]({{site.baseurl}}/img/albums/future-friends.jpg)

I'd replace each of these albums with *Future Friends* by Superfruit and *The College Dropout* by Kanye West. *Future Friends* is the debut album by the duo of Mitch Grassi and Scott Hoying, who are more famously known by being part of the acapella super-group [Pentatonix](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmv1CLT6ZcFdTJMHxaR9XeA). I was a huge fan of Pentatonix's YouTube videos when I was a little younger, and I recently found out about their side music group/YouTube channel, Superfruit. I instantly fell in love - I'm not a huge vlog fan, but the way they're able to connect with their audience, to interact with their listeners in a way that most artists don't, is really cool. I feel like I'm having a conversation with them, which adds a different touch to their music. When I hear their songs, since I kinda know them as people, I see how they're extensions of Scott and Mitch. When I see their music videos (which are [freakin' awesome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2Kh_XMIDPU)), I can feel *them* directing and acting in it. They also make really funny music-related videos (that aren't music videos): a personal favourite is [Hip-Hop Goes Broadway](https://youtu.be/ohBTKf6XZME).

![The College Dropout Album Cover]({{site.baseurl}}/img/albums/college-dropout.jpg)

*The College Dropout* is a classic. It's hip-hop legend Kanye West's debut album, even though at the time he was only known as a producer. When I was 15, I wasn't a huge fan of it - I thought some of the skits and production were dated, and I thought that Graduation was Kanye's best album. But, I only really gave it a deep listen last year, after a personal friend (Kimathi) nagged me to give it a second shot. I'm really glad I did: now that I'm just a bit more mature, and I know a bit more about the world, I can better appreciate what I think is Kanye's deepest album. Songs like *All Falls Down* and *Never Let Me Down* resonate more with me when I can better understand their messages. Even some of the skits, like *School Spirit*, have grown on me.

## le milieu

I apologize, this is some pretty poor writing - I'm in the middle of exams studying and I don't have much time to edit or proofread. But, I wanted to get this thought out - I think one of the coolest things about art is your interpretation of it changes over time.

I'll talk more about my 3 big changes in another post. Until then!
