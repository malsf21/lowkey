For a long time, this site used a Bootstrap theme from Creative Tim - and while that was great, it didn't feel original, and it made the page loading really, really slow. I've swapped it out with my own custom-made CSS Framework, [Liteweight](https://malsf21.github.io/liteweight/)! Now the blog feels a bit more barebones, but I think it also matches the visual of my [home website](https://matthewwang.me/) and I can now safely say I've written all the code that goes into making this website. Feels good, doesn't it?

Anyways, if you're reading and you have some feedback for this design, please send it my way. You can check out Liteweight's GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/malsf21/liteweight), if you have any feedback for the framework in general.
