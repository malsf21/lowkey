Our next album is a very interesting, but also amazing release. Plus, it both brings back nostalgia to the early 2000's and 2010's, and also is a look into modern music. Let's get a  drumroll...

## Album #13: Paramore, by Paramore

**Most Artists have a distinct style:** you hear a song, and you can say, "yeah, that was a [insert band name here]" song. Most bands and solo artists have a distinct sound: the Beatles have a generally airy, uplifting mesh of pop and rock; Beyoncé has a very flagrant, "look at me" style of music; Kendrick Lamar has a very grimy duo of front-facing lyrics and deep meaning. But all of these artists show evolution: the Beatles experimented through all boundaries of Rock; Beyoncé has made songs like *If I Was A Boy*, contrary to her normally swaggy style; Kendrick has rapped in straight bangers like *Vice City*. All of it matters in context. So let's get some

In the early to mid 2000's, Emo-pop music had a huge swell in mainstream popularity. Teenagers in high schools all around the world were listening to *My Chemical Romance*, *Jimmy Eat World*, and *Dashboard Confessional*. Among those bands was also *Paramore*, a young band signed by *Fueled by Ramen*, a then-small emo record label.

Then, abruptly, emo just stopped being cool (like Myspace), just around 2010. Some bands like *Dashboard* just ended up flopping; others, like *Panic! At the Disco*, *Fall Out Boy*, and *Paramore* adapted and changed their sound: all three of those bands are still pretty damn popular today. Interestingly, they're all also signed to *Fueled by Ramen*: as a record label, *Fueled by Ramen* handled the transition very well, and are one of the most influential small labels in the game today (other famous names include *3OH!3*, *Gym Class Heroes*, and *Twenty One Pilots*).

To be more specific, Paramore transitioned from a emo-rock centered style to a more mainstream, pop-rock styling sprinkled with a bit of their emo roots. And goddamn, is that music good. *Ain't It Fun* and *Still Into You* both hit double-platinum, and Ain't It Fun won Best Rock Song for the 2015 Grammy's.

The reason that I liked this album seems a bit irrational: their music is just *goddamn* good. It sounds good. And it's not like all the songs are the same style: Paramore gives you fun, uplifting, punchy tracks like *Anklebiters*; slow, introspective, romantic songs like *Hate To See Your Heart Break*, and pop anthems like *Ain't It Fun*. It is fun. It's great to listen to, whether I'm on a roadtrip, jogging, or just about to fall asleep. It's one of those albums that I've listened to countless times over the years. It's, if you will, one of my all-time faves.

I "discovered" Paramore from a recommendation from a friend: one who has helped me find a metric crapton of great music. I listened to the album, gave myself a few minutes of "holy shit", and then looked through their discography. It's interesting to see how their sound has change: *All We Know Is Falling* sounds absolutely nothing like *Paramore*, and I'm fine with that. I was surprised to find out that the same band that performed *crushcrushcrush* also did *The Only Exception* (which I also absolutely adored, but didn't know it was from Paramore). This in itself sparked me to look into the evolution of other artists: *Panic!*, *Eminem*, and *Kanye*, to name a few.

This combination of *goddamn good music* (I've said this a lot, haven't I) and a delve into the evolution of a music group's sound cements *Paramore* as an amazing album, especially to me. They're certainly an Exception compared to the style of music I usually listen to. But, even though some of us have to grow up sometimes, I'm not going to leave them behind.


**Favourite Songs**: *Fast In My Car, Now, Grow Up, Daydreaming, Ain't It Fun, Part II, Still Into You, Anklebiters, Hate To See Your Heart Break, Be Alone*
