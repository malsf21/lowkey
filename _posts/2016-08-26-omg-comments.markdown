**Oh yeah,** and in the theme of improvements, I've now added comments to the blog. Before, if you disagreed with what I said, you just had to hold it in. Now, you can finally let it go in true Elsa fashion! In addition, you can use *markdown*, and you get an [awesome, adorable, avatar](http://avatars.adorable.io/). How awesome. And adorable.

I was able to implement this with a really, really cool project called [staticman](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman), which can give static sites (like this Jekyll Blog) comments, and other dynamic content. While it's still pretty new, it's some pretttty cool stuff.

Anyways, now that I can finally get feedback, I'm pretty interested to see A) how many people (or just 1 person) read this blog, and B) how bad my writing style is. It's nice to get another fresh pair of eyes on things, so that'll be nice.

I haven't slept in 20 hours +, but that's alright as I'm going to be working on more minor tech things for both my projects, for FoodSpan, and for everything else.

And maybe watch some Netflix. *Maybe.*

Until next time!

*P.S. The comments aren't legit instantaneous comments, or until I figure out webhooks. In the meantime, comments will push every time I check the webserver.*
