I've decided to add a page to this blog titled [Song of the Week]({{site.baseurl}}/stats/song-of-the-week.html) where I document what my favourite song of the week was (blending stats from [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/matthewxwang) with personal opinions). I enjoy reflecting this way, and I'm also curious to see what exactly these songs are, if I still enjoy them 3 months from now, and how close they match my Spotify Top 100 list.

I've used a Jekyll loop to iterate through a `YAML` file - that way, it'll be easier to extend the capabilities of this data in the future.

I also think there's much more potential to analyze and present this data than just listing it out - but that'll come with time. With more data, I'll be able to see more possibilities.

(and I have another article coming)

Until next time!
