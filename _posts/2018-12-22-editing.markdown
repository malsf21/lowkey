It's no secret that I'm a bad writer: this blog is living proof of that. It is nice to know that I've become a slightly better writer over the years (just look at the trash that's the first few posts I've written), but I also want to raise the overall quality of writing on this blog.

As a result, I'm going to start editing and revising some of the articles that I've written (something I didn't want to do earlier due to integrity). However, I'll be transparent about when I do this - every post that's been edited will be tagged like this:

<span class="tag tag-rounded bg-secondary">Edited 12/22/2018</span>

So far, I haven't edited any posts - but I'll get in that rhythm soon.

I'm also going to delete posts that I feel are no longer representative of who I am, or on topics that I don't think are important. To clarify, I've already done this in the past - but I might be more vigilant with it now. Because lowkey always has been (and always will be) open-source, you can always find these old posts and drafts by looking at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/malsf21/lowkey).

Hopefully, this makes this blog a more enjoyable read. Not that it really, really matters.

Until next time!
