**Today** I received a brand new 2015 MacBook Air, trading in my old 2012 MacBook Pro for a much-needed upgrade. I installed Google Drive, customized my terminal, and re-installed all my Steam Games, finishing my upgrade in a record 30 minutes. It's a nice feeling: I have an SSD now, a lighter laptop, and a nicer display, but at the cost of a worse CPU and integrated graphics system.

Why would I tell you all these facts? You probably don't care, do you, but I think there's something deep down inside whenever you swap out computers and/or phones. To many people, including me, a computer or phone is like buying a new bed or a new favourite hoodie: it acts as an extension of yourself, and you mold your lifestyle around the new choice. It might be something small and inconsequential, such as *not* downloading 47 Civilisation V mods, a change in lifestyle, such as bringing your laptop around to coffee shops, or something that might make a big impact in your life, like starting a blog, photo journal, or a selfie-every-day-for-n-years setup. Even today, as I use my new computer, the difference in my routine was night and day. Since it's lighter, my wrists bore into the computer less to keep it still. I can bring it to Starbucks; but alas, I can't play Hearthstone (did you know it has a *2.2GHZ* Recommended clock speed? I didn't!) while I'm there. It means that, while I'm typing up this blog post, I forego having a Javascript linter by my side, as it's tasking on my CPU.

But I'm not here to complain about what my computer could've been: it will undoubtedly change my routine, no matter how small or large. I suspect that when I head to SHAD in July, I'll be a bit more mobile with a slimmer laptop; my back will probably hurt less on my one hour commute with a lighter backpack.

This idea kinda fleshes out the point I want to make: people often say "Whatever, I'll just buy the cheapest Chromebook" or "Eh, Samsung or LG, who cares?". While price and time convenience are important, you have to remember that this is a long-term investment. Having a keyboard that suits you more, a home button at the right place, or an audio jack that's on the bottom of your phone will make your life easier. A lighter laptop will be easier on your back, a bigger phone screen makes Netflix binging easier, headphones with more relaxed headband support won't hurt your ears. Every piece of technology has some sort of personality to it: make sure that it fits yours.  Spending a little time figuring out what you want out of your computer will go a long way in making your day-to-day life better.

When you buy your next tech gadget, don't just look it up on amazon and call it a day: do a bit more research into what you're buying, so it fits *you*. Then, maybe you can install all of those Civ mods.
