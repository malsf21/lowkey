Welcome to Lowkey, a blog where I'll try my best to be funny and show you cool things.

Man, I'm super excited for this blog! I have no ruby experience, have never used jekyll, and am an absolutely new blogger. That being said, hopefully this'll become a cool-ass project that I can look back on two or three years in the future saying, wow Matt, this was a great idea. First things first, I need to formalize my writing style!

Jekyll is a tool that builds websites out of markdown and yaml files. You can check out the [Jekyll docs here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home)!

To quote Sky: I'm excited to be here, and I'm definitely going to be back.

Are you?
