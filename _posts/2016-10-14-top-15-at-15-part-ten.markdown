Poppy, feel-good, uplifting music is always lovely to listen to, and this album is no exception. Let's take a look at:

## Album #6: Doo-Wops and Hooligans by Bruno Mars

Making a good *album* is very hard, especially in pop today. A lot of albums these days are just filler songs for the one or two singles an artist releases (I'm looking at you Kelly Clarkson), so I'm very appreciative of albums that are clean, and have a solid consistent level of quality throughout the entire album (I'm looking at you Rae Sremmurd). That's why I think albums like *Emotion*, *Graduation*, and yes, *Doo-Wops and Hooligans* are so good: even though their singles are catchy, the album is a solid project.

Doo-Wops and Hooligans is actually one of the few albums that I own a CD hard copy of. It's been one of the best pop albums I've heard (so everything after ~2009), mainly because it achieves exactly what people look for in music: **feeling emotion**. Bruno Mars does an amazing job painting a beautiful picture in his songs, whether it's a lovey-dovey , trusting feel-good song in *Count On Me*, a very cat-and-mouse, rock-influenced tease like *Runaway Baby*, or a very sad, but hopeful *Liquor Store Blues*. Even now, listening to *Runaway Baby* makes me want to get up, dance, and get my swagger on. Hearing *Talking To The Moon* makes me want to cry a bit on the inside, and *Just the Way You Are* makes me feel like the prettiest princess in the world. It's hard to explain exactly what creates this kind of emotion. It might be Bruno Mars' energy, or how he blends different musical genres, or how the songs are just so damn catchy. Actually, I think it's all of that, and more. It's a great example of how an album can have cohesion and consistency stylistically, but doesn't need to use a cookie-cutter remplate for each song. *Liquor Store Blues* blends reggae-pop into mainstream pop, while *Marry You* oddly sounds like a happy church song with a very non-church message. Not preachy at all.

I've listened to Doo-Wops and Hooligans for a pretty good amount of time. I think I picked up my CD copy in my local Costco around 2010, but it's stuck with me through my sketchy Sony MP3, Spotify, my three different schools, and a plethora of different life events. It's a great feel-good album in general: even though some of the songs have some not-so-happy content, the entire album flows together a message of hope, love, and laughter. It makes me happy when I'm sad, and even happier when I'm happy. And I'm all for happy.

Ultimately, Doo-Wops and Hooligans is one of those albums I'll remember for a long time: I can see myself in 2066 yelling at kids music because "back in my day" we sang like Bruno Mars, not like whatever convoluted music that'll be what the "hip" kids listen to. It's a piece of memorabilia that represents everything that I should stand for: for being happy, for being loving, and for being hopeful. Hopefully, you can Count On Me to keep these ideals as I grow up. I know I will.

**Favourite Songs**: *Grenade, Just the Way You Are, Runaway Baby, The Lazy Song, Marry You, Talking To The Moon, Liquor Store Blues, Count On Me, The Other Side*

Until next time!
