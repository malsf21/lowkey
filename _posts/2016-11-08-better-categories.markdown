Hello there,

I've taken a break from yelling at you about my music taste to let you know that I've updated the [categories page]({{site.baseurl}}/categories/). Now, it links to a category page, which in turn has links to all page categories: no messy accordions now! I used [jekyll-archives](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-archives/) to set this up, which made everything quite easy.

I've also done some fall cleaning, so the site is cleaner (from a coding standpoint).

A few interesting pieces of site knowledge before I go: I'm thinking of removing comments (because they suck), I'm thinking of using the new theme functionality in jekyll, and I've been experimenting with [jekyll-admin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-admin/), which would be super useful for WAC/OMUN.

Well, that's about it. Have fun, and until next time!
