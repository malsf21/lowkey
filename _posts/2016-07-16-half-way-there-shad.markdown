*Hey there! If you don't know, I'm at SHAD @ Mac (and will be for the next two weeks). While I said I'd post weekly updates, SHAD has been insanely busy; that being said, I'll try my best to talk about it now.*

**SHAD is a very interesting program**: unlike most summer programs (like DEEP), the goal is to build a community and teach life skills, with science taking a backseat. The focus around these life skills makes sense: after all, it's much easier to learn how to name ionic bonds or calculate velocity than how to work as a team, how to lead, and how to make friends. It's compounded by SHAD's uber-diversity; very few SHADs (at least in my personal experience) have similar skillsets. There are ARCT pianists, there are professional yo-yo throwers, there are national level public speak-offs, there are CWSF Gold Medalists, there are internationally ranked javelin throwers. Making teams, and ultimately friends with these people is pretty freaking awesome.

This post is not going to be long; it's quite busy here. But I'll elaborate more in the future.

## Teamwork

**Teamwork** is probably one of the most important skills that anybody will need in their working life. Interacting with other *homo sapiens* is a day-to-day interaction, some of those *homo sapiens* end up working with you on important projects. Normally team building exercises are all about "being nice to people" or "everybody can be a leader"; SHAD teaches it differently.

The first thing that we learned about teamwork was *vulnerability*. Our coordinators answered every single question for 30 minutes, regardless of how personal it was: they talked about their worst failure, the last time they cried, and their paradigm shift moment. It opened them up to all 56 of us SHADs, and it did lead to some awkward moments; but at the same time, we built a level of trust. That vulnerability creates a team environment where each team member has a tangible connection to each team member. I'm not saying that during every meeting everybody needs to gush out their life story; but I'm interested in doing exercises like [this one](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2016-06-09-start-meetings-with-personal-checkins) from the Travis CI team to create a more cohesive team.

A few other important topics that we've touched on: "expecting excellence", [the tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons), understanding perspective, and learning how to create diversity. Obviously that's other stuff, but maybe I'll talk about that another day.

Stay vulnerable, my friends.
