In the spirit of an end-of-year cleanup, I've cleaned up the blog yet again to make it easier to read. The changes aren't too big, but now I do that fad where I set `max-width:75rem;` so the page isn't this huge block of text that's impossible to read. I've also made font sizes more consistent, and things generally easier to read on mobile. Finally, I've dropped Font Awesome: even though it's super awesome, it's also a big file import that we don't **actually** need. Now they're SVG icons in the footer (oh, I changed that too)!

Hopefully, 2016 doesn't do any more bad things to you.

Have a great rest of the year!
