Chance, acid rapper, soccer, hacky sacker, cocky khaki jacket jacker, slap-happy f-... woah woah woah. Regardless of some of the lyrics, I'm excited to present to you this next project:

## Album #8: Acid Rap by Chance the Rapper

**Favourite Songs**: *Good Ass Intro, Pusha Man/Paranoia, Cocoa Butter Kisses, Juice, Lost, Everybody's Something, Interlude (That's Love), Favorite Song, Smoke Again, Acid Rain, Chain Smoker*

Thanks for bearing with me: next up is one of the most famous albums of the 2000's, and the second-oldest album on this list. It's a throwback to all the 90s kids.

Until next time!
