Yeah, the title says it all. I've removed comments from Lowkey.

Comments started off as an experiment with [staticman](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman), a cool way to add dynamic content to static websites. Why did I get rid of comments? Two things:

## Spam

The vast majority of my comments were just straight up spam. Bots typing up random markdown, space-escaped strings (that aren't allowed by human input), advertising some random website that doesn't work properly. Ultimately, I don't want my site to be a method of free advertising for the one viewer that watches it. Plus, it's super annoying seeing a Pull Request for a comment, being super happy, and then realising that it was just a bot. That sucks.

## Content

Even when I got actual comments, they still sucked. They were mostly memes, and nothing was actual commentary on what I wrote. To be fair, I'm not sure what I really expected from the internet.

Well, that's it to close off this short blog post. I'll try my best to blog more (but right now is a very, very busy time for me), and I promise to complete 15/15 before the end of the school year.

Until next time!
