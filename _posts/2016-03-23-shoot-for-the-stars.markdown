![My Starbucks Rewards](http://matthewwang.me/blog/img/2016-03-23-MSR.png "My Starbucks Rewards")

**Starbucks Canada**, for a long time, has had a rewards program called *My Starbucks Rewards*. Recently, they've announced that a new program, *Starbucks Rewards*, will be replacing MSR in April. And, this wouldn't be Matt Wang without some article about Starbucks, so let's go over the changes.

Let's go over how *My Starbucks Rewards*, or *MSR*, worked in the past. Simply, you'd get a star per visit; and every 12 stars you get a free drink, but only if you had a *Gold Card.* In order to get a *Gold Card*, you first needed 30 visits, jumping through the *Welcome Level* and the *Green Level*. This system rewarded you for coming to Starbucks a lot, which is exactly what a rewards system needs to do. Unfortunately for me, I wasn't the businessman who came in every day and picked up a $3 coffee, I was the one who came in every other week picking up a $5 specialty drink, or buying a group-buy option of 20+ drinks. While there were workarounds, it wasn't the ideal situation for me. Regardless, let's take a look at what the system gets you:

| Order            | MSR #Stars    | MSR % Free Drink  |
| -----------------|:-------------:| :-----:|
| Tall Latté (~$3.50) | 1          | 8.33% |
| Venti JCF (~$5.50)  | 1          | 8.33% |
| 3 Tall Flat Whites (~$13)    | 1 | 8.33% |
| 3 Venti JCFs (~$16.50)       | 1 | 8.33% |
| A Tall Latté everyday for 1 week (~$24.50) | 7 | 58.83% |
| A Venti JCF everyday for 1 week (~$38.50) | 7 | 58.83% |
</br>


Rather simple. In order to get a free drink, you need to come in on twelve different days. You need to spend $35.40 on just Tall Lattés to get a free drink, or

Now let's see how up-and-coming *Starbucks Rewards* (or *SR*) is going to look like. Instead of getting 1 star per visit, you now get 2 stars *per dollar you spend*. **Damn**. Then, you need 125 stars to get a free reward in *Gold*, and 300 to get to *Gold* in the first place. They've dropped the *Welcome* level, kept the *Green* level, and have promised more incentives in the future.

Let's see how that means for our test Starbucks cases:

| Order            | MSR #Stars    | MSR % Free Drink  |
| -----------------|:-------------:| :-----:|
| Tall Latté (~$3.50) | 7          | 5.6% |
| Venti JCF (~$5.50)  | 11         | 8.8% |
| 3 Tall Flat Whites (~$13)   | 26 | 20.8% |
| 3 Venti JCFs (~$16.50)      | 33 | 26.4% |
| A Tall Latté everyday for 1 week (~$24.50) | 49 | 39.2% |
| A Venti JCF everyday for 1 week (~$38.50) | 77 | 61.6% |
</br>

Okay, I'm not going to lie, calculating this was a pain. I actually used my calculator for it, though there's a tool I've linked below that you can use to figure out what's more cost efficient. Let's take a look for our test case to see which plan benefits who:

| Order                                      | MSR % | SR % |
| -------------------------------------------|:----------------:| :-----:|
| Tall Latté (~$3.50)                        | 8.33%            | 5.6%  |
| Venti JCF (~$5.50)                         | 8.33%            | 8.8%  |
| 3 Tall Flat Whites (~$13)                  | 8.33%            | 20.8% |
| 3 Venti JCFs (~$16.50)                     | 8.33%            | 26.4% |
| A Tall Latté everyday for 1 week (~$24.50) | 58.83%           | 39.2% |
| A Venti JCF everyday for 1 week (~$38.50)  | 58.83%           | 61.6% |

Hm, there's a few trends we need to take a look at.
1. The old MSR system favors cheaper drinks, while the new SR system favors more expensive drinks. This should be no surprise, as the old system is based off of per-visit, while the new system is based off of per-price.
2. The old MSR system also obviously favors commitment in visiting, while the new SR system favors binge-buying.
3. **The new SR system beats the old SR system on more expensive premium drinks** (like the Java Chip Frappe, you should try it out), **even in the categories it's supposed to be "behind" in**.

#3 is probably the most important one.

If you're the kind of person who only goes to Starbucks to get a cheap, early-morning coffee once a day, this new change isn't going to be great for your ability to get free drinks. That being said, **who actually goes to Starbucks to pick up cheap coffee?** Starbucks is a premium, "artsy" and trending coffee house that sells its atmosphere and brand as much as it sells its coffee. The average Starbucks visitor doesn't go in to buy a tall Caffé Latté, the average Starbucks visitor comes in to try new seasonal drinks, Frappes, and new blends. Obviously, I'm generalising, but this new awards system seems to **favor Starbucks' demographic**, and probably persuade them to shop more. Sounds like a win-win to me!

And, this doesn't even include everything else Starbucks sells, such as Bistro Boxes, pastries, coffee mugs, and coffee grinds. All in all, this seems like a great change for most Starbucks visitors.

Happy Caramelized Honey Latté Season!
