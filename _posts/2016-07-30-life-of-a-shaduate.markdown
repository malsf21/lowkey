**I'm sad.** Not because of how depressing the world is (though it is, and I'll allude to this later), but because I'm going to miss a lot of people. 55 SHADs, 7 PAs, an AF, and 4 Senior Staff, to be exact.

I'm "celebrating" my first day away from the SHAD program, which brands itself as a STEM camp in 10 different Canadian university campuses (I went to SHAD @ McMaster). SHAD is so much more than just a STEM camp: it's a camp that teaches you about leadership, community, and relationships. It's a camp where I've learned amazing things, visited amazing places, and met amazing friends.

It's hard for me to explain what SHAD really meant to me (it meant a lot) but I want to answer a few of the questions that I asked myself throughout the program.

### How long do you need to know someone to call them your friend? Good friend? Best friend?

This is an interesting question, since I've never made so many *best friends* (if that's possible) in one month. I spent a total of 27 days with all of the SHADs, yet I feel like some of the bonds that I've made with them are much stronger than ones with people I've known for years. To be fair, I'm normally not in close proximity with most of my friend group for 24 hours a day, for 27 days in a row, but it's not the whole story. SHAD aims to bring "the brightest minds of Canada" together, and while I find that a bit pretentious, there is some truth to that statement. You meet people who have deep **passions**, whether it be professional yo-yo-ing (I've been told that this is called being a "thrower"), ARCT and national pianists, internationally-competing javelin throwers, or really, really, really loving mechanical keyboards (that'd be me). Each of these passions is diverse in breadth and depth; and being close to people who have passions *this important* to them creates a special connection like no other. With many of my "school friends", sure we know each other, but I don't exactly know what makes them tick, and I certainly can't grasp the amount of love and effort they've put into it. At SHAD, it couldn't be more different. I know what everybody's passion is; what they've put their ten thousand hours into, and I respect that.

To answer the question (something that I'm pretty bad at), I'd say less than an hour for a friend. As long as they aren't discernibly a total asshole in the **first hour** of meeting them, we can probably be *friends*. The elevation to *good friend*, which is a very arbitrary term in itself, is relevant to what I just talked about: passion. Most of the SHADs fall into this category: they've verified that they aren't douches, and they've demonstrated their ability to work hard, play hard, and love long and hard. Timeframe I think here is also arbitrary: I've had just *friends* for 8 years and running, but some of the SHADs I knew I was going to be good friends with in the first **24 hours**. So I'll stick with that.

**Best friends** isn't my favourite term, especially because I think you can have more than one best friend. For me, you have situational best friends: my best friend when I need to talk about a serious issue is different from my best friend when I need to just chill out and have fun. A best friend needs to be somebody that impacts your life in a measurably positive way, whether it being someone who you've put hours and hours in to practice *Magic* by B.o.B in, or somebody who you've had late night talk after late night talk about your problems, and your eventual solutions. Similar to *good friends*, I think that there's no good measure of time to find a best friend: some of the people I know from SHAD I would consider best friends (though I've also been told I'm a friend whore, so who knows). I made my first best friend at SHAD in **3 days**.

The friendships I've made at SHAD are ones that I hopefully don't forget for a long time. They've impacted my life in ways that I couldn't have imagined a month ago, and hopefully I returned the favor.

### What is perfection? Is "perfect" reasonable? Can something or someone every be "perfect"?

I wasn't the only one that came into SHAD with this question, and it's a huge focus on a lot of people in my generation: you need to be perfect to truly succeed. Our program director told us a different story. He said:

> Perfection is only a function of resources and time.

And, I've got to say, he's got a pretty good point. We did an exercise to illustrate this, called the *Time Machine*. Basically, we had to make a contraption that stopped a marble as close to ten seconds as possible. A pretty easy task, right? Here's the catch: we were given only a cardboard box, a few spoons, popsicle sticks, straight pins, elastic bands, tape, and coiling wire. We also only had 1 and a half hours.

Not a single team did it. The longest time they were able to consistently slow the ball was a total of 7 seconds. It seemed like a failure.

**But it wasn't**. With those resources, and with that small amount of time, it is nearly impossible for anybody, even structural engineers, to make something do exactly that. Perfection is only what is attainable, and if your goal of perfection is unattainable, then it's not truly perfection. That 7 seconds was perfection, in that specific case; if we were given more time, and better resources, maybe it would've gone farther than 7 seconds. This message holds true for almost anything in life: whether it's a school assignment, work project, or a piece of art. You need to finish it. You need to bring it as close as possible to the literal perfection, and you need to be real.

I don't think that someone or somebody can ever be literally perfect. If you go by my definition of perfect, with more time and resources, you can always improve yourself; but at the same time, you can't judge yourself by an impossible comparison. I think that not being perfect has to be the drive for you to go further in life; but at the same time, you need to have a positive attitude. "I'm not perfect" should only be followed by "but I'll keep trying".

### Au Revoir

I'm going to talk more about SHAD in the upcoming week, and answer a few more introspective questions. Until next time.
