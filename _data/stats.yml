    genre: "rap"
    year: 1994
    blurb: >
      Considering the prominence of "Gimme The Loot" as a producer tag and adlib, I thought it'd be nice to take it back to the OG. Biggie is just a straight killer on this track.

    genre: "pop"
    year: 2019
    blurb: >
      Billie's brings a unique, consistent, and pretty spooky sound: a welcome addition to a pop scene filled with bland mediocrity, and from a 17 year-old no less.
  week15:
    week: "Week 15: Apr 5 - Apr 11"
    title: "Butterflies"
