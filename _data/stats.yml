      This is the catchiest sanger (sad banger) I've heard so far. The lyrics are so simple, yet so depressing.

    album_art: "french-exit.jpg"
    genre: "indie pop"
    year: 2014
    blurb: >
      Lovers Rock is entrancing, smooth pop at its best - something I imagine in the background of an upscale restaurant.

    album_art: "yolmwtlo.jpg"
    genre: "alt rock"
    year: 2016
    blurb: >
      Strong, raw guitars and an equally raw voice addictingly convey a truth that nobody wants to hear.

    artist: "Travis Scott"
    album: "Astroworld"
    album_art: "astroworld.jpg"
    genre: "rap"
    year: 2018
    blurb: >
      Travis weaves together a spooky vibe with a haunting piano chord, barebones beats, and his signature eerie autotune.

    title: "Gimme The Loot"
    artist: "The Notorious B.I.G"

    album_art: "ready-to-die.jpg"
    genre: "rap"
    year: 1994
    blurb: >
      Considering the prominence of "Gimme The Loot" as a producer tag and adlib, I thought it'd be nice to take it back to the OG. Biggie is just a straight killer on this track.

    album_art: "locket.jpg"
    genre: "indie rock"
    year: 2017

      Locket is a tantalizing earworm, a combination of smooth rock and jazz-like elements that's been stuck in my head for the past few weeks.

    title: "No Drug Like Me"

    genre: "indie rock"
    year: 2018
    blurb: >
      Pristine is yet another addition to simp session bedroom pop and indie rock - as clichÃ© as it sounds, you really do feel her pain.

    genre: "pop"

      Billie's brings a unique, consistent, and pretty spooky sound: a welcome addition to a pop scene filled with bland mediocrity, and from a 17 year-old no less.
