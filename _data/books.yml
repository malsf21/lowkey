    Kafka on the Shore was my first Murakami venture, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The world that Murakami weaves is immaculate; I feel at home in a place that I've never been in. Kafka's ensemble of characters bring just enough to the table to make every chapter a page-turner, but leave plenty to the imagination - and something that makes this coming-of-age story easily and eerily relatable.

    Fresh off of Kafka on the Shore, I was motivated to binge some Murakami, and 1Q84 received a strong recommendation from a friend. Murakami dips you head-first into a truly entracing literary universe, with amazingly elegant world-building and one of my favourite set of leads. Yet, I can't also help but feel that the plot is a bit unfocused compared to his other, more concise books, and that the book gets... a little disturbing. Still, for fans of Murakami or surrealist fiction, I'd definitely recommend 1Q84.

    Cloud Atlas, no doubt, is a very unique book. David Mitchell seamlessly switches between narrative and historical styles to build dramatic, engaging worlds. I will say, I was less wowed by the fantastical journey through time than most - I think Homegiong by Yaa Gyasi still takes the cake for me in this genre - but nevertheless, it's an amazing and special journey.

    Camus's brief tour into absurdist existentialism is as intriguing as it is concise. I won't claim to fully understand all of the philosophical implications of this novel (I'd need a much better philosophy training for that), but I can clearly recognize why it's immortalised as one of the best books ever written, period. My only regret is that I couldn't read it in (my admittedly terrible) French.

  title: Good Economics for Hard Times
  author: Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo
  genre: Economics
  year_published: 2019

    Economics has the reputation of being the dismal science, with arcane (and often wrong) predictions and little statistical backing. The recent Nobel laureates do a great job of disproving that, showcasing what "Good Economics" really looks like: examining the world through an analytical lens, blending together innovations from statistics, mathematical modelling, and medicine to get a solid grasph on world phenomemon. Easily one of my favourite (~pop) economics books I've read.
flowersforalgernon:
  title: Flowers for Algernon
  author: Daniel Keyes
  genre: Science Fiction
  year_published: 1959
  time_read: April 2020

    For a book published in 1959 (and penned as a short story in 1958), Flowers for Algernon ages surprisingly well. We watch the transformation of a man who has been failed by society time and time again; it's telling that this story could've been very well set in 2020, with little impact on its narrative. By far one of the tamest controversial banned books that I've ever read, and if anything, a great introspective short read for young adults.
norwegianwood:

  genre: Coming of Age

    The novel that really shot Murakami into national and international fame is beautiful, nuanced, and emotional. Granted, I haven't read many coming-of-age books, but Norwegian Wood is amazing regardless of genre: our protagonist's journey is as much of a whirlwind as it is a slow burn, as the book explores the process of trauma and its long-lasting impacts on life.

    To many, this is Murakami's magnum opus, and I wouldn't disagree. From an extremely mundane and typical man and environment, Murakami conjures yet another fantastical story: one that touches on Japanese suburbia, war crimes in World War II, and a set of relationships set around existentialism and death. As magical as this book is, it's definitely in the "odd reads" category; but still, it has my complete recommendation.

  thoughts: >
    The Elephant Vanishes is an intriguing set of short stories, combining seemingly banal life stories and environments with a deep dive into surrealism, loneliness, and trauma. As with most short story compilations, some stories hit harder than others, but every story was memorable in a very unique, Murakami way. Favourite stories are probably Sleep, Barn Burning, and The Silence.
narrativeeconomics:
  title: Narrative Economics
  author: Robert J. Shiller
  genre: Economics
  year_published: 2019
  time_read: June/July 2020
  thoughts: >
    Robert Shiller conjures up a lens to examine the economic world through the idea of economics narratives: popular stories that have undue power over people, companies, and governments. I'm not sure if I'm fully ready to buy into narrative economics just yet, but he makes a solid case; Shiller comes equipped with the modern tools of data science and textual analysis to examine the most important economic stories of the West.
