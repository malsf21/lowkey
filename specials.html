  Here are a few specials I've done, some of which are organized for binge reading (how exciting)! Just click on a special to get started.

  <h2><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/specials/hindsight2018/">Hindsight 20/18</a></h2>
  <p>
    Hindsight is 20/20. I reflect on the end of my high school career, talk about the things that defined me as an individual, and look forward to a new chapter of my life. In each article, I examine a specific activity I did, and how it affected my life.

<div class="card border-primary">
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/specials/15at15/">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/vinyl-turntable.jpg" alt="Vinyl Turntable"/>
  </a>
  <h2><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/specials/15at15/">Top 15 Albums at 15</a></h2>
  <p>
    I walk you through my Top 15 most impactful albums at 15, and tell a few long, off-topic stories that somehow all come together to make one coherent series. Plus, there's an honourable mention section, and many things I write about that you can use to make fun of me.

<div class="card border-primary">
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/specials/shad2016/">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/shad.png" alt="SHAD Logo"/>
  </a>
  <h2><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/specials/shad2016/">SHAD 2016</a></h2>
  <p>
    SHAD was a life-changing experience for me. I talk to you about why in this special, with some juicy introspective reflection.
