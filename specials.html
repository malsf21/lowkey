<p>
  Specials are series of posts that I write that touch on an overall theme. They're organized here for binge reading, if you really feel like reading that much bad writing.

{% for special in site.specials %}
<div class="card border-primary">
  <a class="post-listing" href="{{site.baseurl}}/specials/{{special.tag}}/">{{special.title}}</a>
  {{special.content}}
</div>
{% endfor %}
