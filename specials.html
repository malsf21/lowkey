      <h2><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/specials/15at15/">Top 15 Albums at 15</a></h2>
      <p>
        I walk you through my Top 15 most impactful albums at 15, and tell a few long, off-topic stories that somehow all come together to make one coherent series. Plus, there's an honourable mention section, and many things I write about that you can use to make fun of me.

      <h2><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/specials/shad2016/">SHAD 2016</a></h2>
      <p>
        SHAD was a life-changing experience for me. I talk to you about why in this special, with some juicy introspective reflection.
