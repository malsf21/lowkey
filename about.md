## About Lowkey

Since kids these days are supposed to be young and hip, lets take the definition of Lowkey from [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=low+key&defid=1312270):

> to keep something Lowkey: to not announce it;

> to have a quiet gathering;

> opposite of a large party or big group of people; not much emphasis, closely aligned with a normal night out doing the usual stuff.

> "im going out tonight but it's pretty Lowkey; i've gotta work tomorrow so tonight's going to be a Lowkey event."

To be honest, I like [this definition much better](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=low+key&defid=2721080), but Lowkey embodies the spirit of this blog. I'm certainly no expert on any of the topics that I topic about; it's more about what piques my interest, and what I think is cool. I'm not there to make flashy declarations, intense debates, or rally for social change (maybe I should make a blog called Highkey for that). Hopefully, you find this stuff cool as well.
