![An image logo of Lowkey]({{site.baseurl}}/img/lowkey-transparent.png)

Since kids these days are supposed to be young and hip, lets take the definition of Lowkey from [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=low+key&defid=1312270):

> to keep something Lowkey: to not announce it;

> opposite of a large party or big group of people; not much emphasis, closely aligned with a normal night out doing the usual stuff.

> "im going out tonight but it's pretty Lowkey; i've gotta work tomorrow so tonight's going to be a Lowkey event."

Ultimately, this blog is supposed to be lowkey. I'm not here to make any broad sweeping declarations; in fact, my goal with this blog is to improve my writing skills. Along the way, I hope I end up telling some funny stories, or introduce you to new music, or maybe even learn something from my misfortune. Who knows?

Okay, but who am I?

Hey there! My name is Matt, and I'm a teenager living in Toronto Ontario. I do a lot of computer science, and debate, and maybe play a bit too many video games. I love listening to music and reading in my free time, and I'll often talk about that on this blog as well.

If you'd like, you can find my website at [matthewwang.me](https://matthewwang.me), which has a bit more about me and what I do. I also stream on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/malsf21), if you want to see me play some video games, actively do stuff on [GitHub](https://github.com/malsf21/), if you want to see me attempt to code thing, and [tweet](https://twitter.com/malsf21), where I attempt (and fail) to be funny.

If you do enjoy reading this blog, please let me know! I'm working on improving my writing style and telling cool stories. If you don't enjoy reading this blog, also let me know! I'll try to make things better for next time.
