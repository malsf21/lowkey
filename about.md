![An image logo of Lowkey]({{site.baseurl}}/img/lowkey-transparent.png)

Since kids these days are supposed to be young and hip, lets take the definition of Lowkey from [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=low+key&defid=1312270):

> to keep something Lowkey: to not announce it;

Ultimately, this blog is supposed to be lowkey. I started it to improve my writing skills, not to make any broad declarations. Along the way, I hope I end up telling some funny stories, or introduce you to new music, or maybe even learn something from my misfortune. Who knows?

Okay, but who am I?

Hey there! My name is Matt, and I'm a teenager living in Toronto Ontario. I do a lot of computer science, and debate, and maybe play a bit too many video games. I love listening to music and reading in my free time, and I'll often talk about that on this blog as well.

If you'd like, you can find my website at [matthewwang.me](https://matthewwang.me), which has a bit more about me and what I do. I also stream on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/malsf21), if you want to see me play some video games, actively do stuff on [GitHub](https://github.com/malsf21/), if you want to see me attempt to code thing, and [tweet](https://twitter.com/malsf21), where I attempt (and fail) to be funny.

If you do enjoy reading this blog, please let me know! I'm working on improving my writing style and telling cool stories. If you don't enjoy reading this blog, also let me know! I'll try to make things better for next time.
