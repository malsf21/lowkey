## About Lowkey

Since kids these days are supposed to be young and hip, lets take the definition of Lowkey from [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=low+key&defid=1312270):

> to keep something Lowkey: to not announce it;

> to have a quiet gathering;

> opposite of a large party or big group of people; not much emphasis, closely aligned with a normal night out doing the usual stuff.

> "im going out tonight but it's pretty Lowkey; i've gotta work tomorrow so tonight's going to be a Lowkey event."

To be honest, I like [this definition much better](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=low+key&defid=2721080), but Lowkey embodies the spirit of this blog. I'm not here to make some big, flashy statements that polarize people and spark intense, serious discussions. Instead, this blog is simply here to provide a bit of fun, insight, or rationale for what's going on in our world, whether it be politically, technologically, or socially. As the youngsters say, this is a "chill" blog.
